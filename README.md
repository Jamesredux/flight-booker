App created as part of the odin project

Features I have added, will add

A search facility. Once you have made a booking you can input the reference
to bring up the booking details.

Also want to create a confirmation page after the passengers are input
that will give the opportunity to change things. Either start again or just edit flight
details or passenger details.

Also create user accounts so user can sign in and store passenger details.
